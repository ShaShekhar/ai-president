This is the list of Presiden Joe Biden Record and his top accomplishments.
When President Biden took office, our country faced unprecedented crises - a raging pandemic, \

to move quickly to tackle these crises head-on and deliver results for working families. \
That’s what the Biden Administration has done.

Top Accomplishments

1. Lowering Costs of Families’ Everyday Expenses:
The Inflation Reduction Act is a significant law that lowers costs for families, \
addresses climate change, reduces the deficit, and ensures large corporations pay \
their fair share in taxes. It also allows Medicare to negotiate drug prices, caps \
insulin costs for seniors, eliminates out-of-pocket costs for vaccines, and limits \
seniors' pharmacy expenses. Additionally, gas prices have dropped significantly due \
to actions taken by the President.

2. More People Are Working Than At Any Point in American History:
As a result of President Biden’s economic plan, 2021 and 2022 were the two strongest years of job growth \
in history. Nearly 11 million jobs have been created since President Biden took office – including 750,000 \
manufacturing jobs. The unemployment rate is at a 50-year low, and a record number of small businesses have \
started since President Biden took office. Black Americans and Hispanic Americans have near record low \
unemployment rates and people with disabilities are experiencing record low unemployment.

3. Making More in America:
As a result of historic legislation, the President has signed into law, there is a manufacturing boom taking \
hold across America: in two years, companies have announced nearly $300 billion in manufacturing investments \
in the United States. These investments are ensuring the technologies of the future are made in America, and \
bringing back supply chains from overseas.

4. Rescued the Economy and Changed the Course of the Pandemic:
Soon after taking office, with a pandemic raging and an economy reeling, the President signed the \
American Rescue Plan to change the course of the pandemic and jumpstart our economic recovery. The \
American Rescue Plan funded our successful vaccination campaign, safely re-opened schools for in-person \
learning, helped 200,000 child care providers keep their doors open, and delivered relief to American families.

5. Rebuilding our Infrastructure:
Washington policymakers celebrated "infrastructure week" without ever delivering. President Biden \
got it done. He worked across the aisle to forge consensus and passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure \
Law – a once-in-a-generation investment in our nation’s infrastructure. We are rebuilding our roads, \
bridges, ports, and airports, upgrading public transit and rail systems, replacing lead pipes to \
provide clean water, cleaning up pollution, providing affordable high-speed internet to every family \
in America, delivering cheaper and cleaner energy to households and businesses.

6. Historic Expansion of Benefits and Services for Toxic Exposed Veterans:
President Biden signed into law the PACT Act – the most significant expansion of benefits and services \
for toxic exposed veterans in more than 30 years. This law also enables the Department of Veterans \
Affairs to move more quickly in the future to determine if illnesses are related to military service, \
and it offers critical support to survivors who were harmed by exposures.

7. The First Meaningful Gun Violence Reduction Legislation in 30 Years:
President Biden brought together Democrats and Republicans to pass the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, \
the first major piece of gun safety legislation in three decades. The law will save lives by requiring \
young people ages 18 to 21 to undergo enhanced background checks; narrowing the "boyfriend loophole" to \
keep guns out of the hands of convicted dating partners; funding crisis interventions, including extreme \
risk protection order ("red flag") laws; making significant investments to address the mental health crisis \
in America.

8. Protected Marriage for LGBTQI and Interracial Couples:
Over ten years ago, President Biden announced his support for marriage equality, becoming the \
highest-ranking U.S. government official to do so. Building on his longstanding support and \
generations of civil rights advocacy, President Biden signed historic bipartisan legislation \
protecting marriage for same-sex and interracial couples. And, the President took historic \
steps to advance full equality for LGBTQI+ Americans, including reversing the discriminatory \
ban on transgender

9. Historic Confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and Federal Judges \
of Diverse Backgrounds:
President Biden nominated and the Senate confirmed Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, \
the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court. Justice Jackson is one of our \
nation’s brightest legal minds and has unprecedented experience in our legal system. \
President Biden’s other judicial appointees include record percentages of women, racial \
and ethnic minorities, and civil rights lawyers and public defenders.

10. Rallied the World to Support Ukraine in Response to Putin’s Aggression
Since the start of President Putin’s unprovoked and unjustified full-scale invasion of \
Ukraine, President Biden has rallied the world to rise to the moment, stand up to autocracy, \
and defend democracy. President Biden has worked around the clock with partners and allies to \
support the people of Ukraine, coordinate and impose unprecedented economic costs against Russia, \
and secure robust bipartisan support at home to deliver critical weapons and economic and \
humanitarian assistance for Ukraine.

11. Strengthened Alliances and Partnerships to Deliver for the American People
Under President Biden's leadership, America's global alliances and partnerships are \
stronger than ever. This approach is evident in his swift action to strengthen NATO \
after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, including bolstering allies, expanding membership, \
and using the G7 to coordinate international responses. In the Indo-Pacific, security \
and economic partnerships have deepened to counter China's influence. Across continents, \
President Biden is building coalitions to address shared challenges and ensure the United \
States plays a key role in shaping the future world order.

12. Successful Counterterrorism Missions Against the Leaders of Al Qaeda and ISIS:
At President Biden’s direction, the United States took key leaders of ISIS and Al Qaeda off the \
battlefield, demonstrating our resolve and ability to defend the American people against those \
who seek to do us harm and in ways that do not require risking the lives of thousands of Americans \
on the ground.

13. Executive Orders Protecting Reproductive Rights:
Since the Supreme Court took away a constitutional right from the American people, President Biden \
and Vice President Harris are taking action to defend reproductive rights. The President has signed \
Executive Orders to protect access to reproductive health care, including abortion and contraception, \
and safeguard patient privacy and sensitive health information, and has made clear his commitment to \
fighting any attack by a state or local official who attempts to interfere with women exercising their \
constitutional right to travel out of state for medical care.

14. Historic Student Debt Relief for Middle- and Working-Class Families
The Biden Administration announced debt relief of up to $20,000 for Americans earning less than \
$125,000 per year who had Pell Grants in college, and up to $10,000 for all other borrowers below \
that income threshold. More than 40 million borrowers stand to benefit from this action, and about \
20 million would see their debt entirely wiped out - and nearly 90% of this relief will go to borrowers \
earning less than $75,000 per year.

15. Advancing Equity and Racial Justice, Including Historic Criminal Justice Reform:
On his first day in office, President Biden signed a historic executive order directing the federal \
government to use every tool available to advance equity and racial justice. As a result, the \
Administration has taken bold action to narrow the racial wealth gap, invest in communities facing \
persistent poverty, and advance programs and policies to deliver racial justice.

16. Delivering on the Most Aggressive Climate and Environmental Justice Agenda in American History:
The U.S. is positioned to achieve our ambitious climate goals of cutting our emissions in \
half by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050. The President has taken executive action and \
signed legislation to develop clean energy at home, accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles, \
and reduce pollution that endangers overburdened communities.

17. More People with Health Insurance Than Ever Before:
President Biden took action to lower the cost of health care for millions of Americans. Right now, \
four out of five people who sign up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act can find \
health care coverage for $10 a month or less and millions of Americans on Obamacare are saving an \
average of $800 a year. Since he took office, there has been a combined 50 percent increase in \
enrollment in states that use HealthCare.gov and the nation’s uninsured rate is historically low at \
8 percent.
